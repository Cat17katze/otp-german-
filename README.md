# otp-german- English descryption
You can encrypt and decrypt files that use the one time pad. 

You can download a pre- compilled .exe, that was compiled with auto-py-to-exe. I recomment the executing with the orginal python file.
I want to translate the german python file to an english one. I'm a student and I can't programm all the time.
